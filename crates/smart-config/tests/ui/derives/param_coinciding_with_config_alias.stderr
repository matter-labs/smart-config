  |          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ the evaluated program panicked at 'Name / alias `field` of param `TestConfig.field` coincides with a name / alias of a nested config `TestConfig.nested`. This is an unconditional error; config deserialization relies on the fact that configs never coincide with params', $DIR/tests/ui/derives/param_coinciding_with_config_alias.rs:8:10
