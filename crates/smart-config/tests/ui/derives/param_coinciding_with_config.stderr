error[E0080]: evaluation of constant value failed
 --> tests/ui/derives/param_coinciding_with_config.rs:8:10

  |          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ evaluation panicked: Name / alias `nested` of param `TestConfig.field` coincides with a name / alias of a nested config `TestConfig.nested`. This is an unconditional error; config deserialization relies on the fact that configs never coincide with params

  = note: this error originates in the derive macro `DescribeConfig` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
