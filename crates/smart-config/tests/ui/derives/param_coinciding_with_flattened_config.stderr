   |          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ the evaluated program panicked at 'Name / alias `nested` of param `TestConfig.nested` coincides with a name / alias of a nested config `FlattenedConfig.nested`. This is an unconditional error; config deserialization relies on the fact that configs never coincide with params', $DIR/tests/ui/derives/param_coinciding_with_flattened_config.rs:14:10

   = note: this error originates in the derive macro `DescribeConfig` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
